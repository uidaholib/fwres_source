New Forestry in the Inland Northwest,"""New Forestry"" refers to the new methods of forest management and timber harvest that are evolving in response to public concerns about clear-cutting and the impacts of logging on aesthetics, water quality, wildlife and biodiversity, and the health and sustainability of forests. These concerns apply to public and private lands and New Forestry seeks to provide forest management and timber harvest methods that minimize impacts and maintain fully functioning and healthy forests. New forestry methods are yet untested and remain to be fully demonstrated, despite the fact that probable implications include reduced harvests and increased costs. Safety factors and the extent of environmental benefits have not yet been measured. This paper reviews some of the new philosophy of forest land management and terminology commonly used to describe new management directions.","Adams, David L.",,1992-01-01,,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Miscellaneous Publication 16,"Idaho QH76.5 I2 M57, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/","College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences;",uifwre-mp16,"some have it, some don't, all need to be: Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Anti-Quality Factors in Rangeland and Pastureland Forages,"The goal of this publication is to review major anti-quality factors that influence livestock production on range and pasture lands. Anti-quality components of forages are quite simply any factor inherent in forage that limits the ability of a grazing animal to reach its potential for growth and reproduction. There are a number of frequently encountered effects of anti-quality factors such s bloat, mineral disorders, nitrate toxicity, poisonings from plant toxins such as glycosides or alkaloids, neurological effects, photosensitization, and disorders associated with microorganisms and insects. Lignin, tannins, thorns, and spatial arrangements of plants are also considered anti-quality attributes because they reduce intake or digestibility. This management bulletin is the outgrowth of a symposium on anti-quality attributes of rangeland and pastureland forages presented at the 1999 joint meeting of the American Forage and Grassland Council (AFGC) and the society for Range Management (SRM).",,"Launchbaugh, K.L.",2001-07-01,,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Station Bulletin 73,"Idaho QH76.5 I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/",Natural Resources Conservation Service; U.S. Department of Agriculture;,uifwre-sb73,"some have it, some don't, all need to be: Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Shrub-Steppe Vegetation of the East Fork and the Middle Fork of the Salmon River Drainages,"Authors describe nineteen shrub-steppe communities in the Middle Fork and East Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho. Bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) and Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis) occur as dominants or major subdominants throughout the region. Big sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata), threetip sagebrush (A. tripartita), and low sagebrush (A.arbuscula) are dominants, especially in the East Fork and southern Middle Fork. Antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) communities exist throughout the region but are most abundant along the Middle Fork, where the species also occurs as a dominant in the understory of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands on drier sites. Cliffy areas in all regions have curlleaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius) and little greenbush (Glossopetalon nevadense) stands, reflecting the specialized habitats on which these communities occur. Shadscale saltbush (Atriplex confertifolia) communities occupy the driest sites in the lower East Fork. Common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), antelope bitterbrush, big sagebrush, threetip sagebrush, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and needle-and-thread (Hesperostipa comata) are well represented in the plant communities. Bluebunch wheatgrass or Idaho fescue or both dominate grassland communities. Needle-and-thread dominates on some xeric, sandy sites. The presence of ponderosa pine or Douglas fir in shrub communities suggests these are successional stages of conifer-dominated community types. At least six conifer communities are represented in ten stands dominated by common snowberry, in thirteen dominated by ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus), five dominated by Idaho fescue, and three dominated by mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana). Seven sites exclosed between 1915 and 1950 provide evidence of reduction in shrubs and expansion of grassland and herbaceous portions of these communities in the Middle Fork. A record of a stand photographed in 1925, 1968, and 1988 appears to corroborate these findings. Changes in species composition of these communities are attributed to changes in species of herbivores, including livestock, mule deer, and elk; to alterations in the natural fire regime; and to weather patterns that affected woody and herbaceous plants differently over the period. The major fire of 2000 in the Middle Fork drainage appears to have increased cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) at least temporarily, and to have reduced nonresprouting shrubs including big sagebrush, curlleaf mountain mahogany, and antelope bitterbrush. Subsequent establishment of new plants from seeds has occurred on sites burned in the most recent fires. Productivity of bluebunch wheatgrass was reduced for one year following the 2000 fire.","Peek, James M.; Yeo, Jeffrey J.; Hickey, William O.; Lauer, Jerry L.; Claar, James C.",,2005,,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Station Bulletin 82,"Idaho QH76.5 I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/",The Nature Conservancy; Salmon National Forest; Umatilla Agency; U.S. Forest Service Region 1;,uifwre-sb82,"some have it, some don't, all need to be: Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Long-Term Vegetation Changes in Permanent Quadrats at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Site,"The objective of this study was to detect long-term changes in natural vegetation of the area (Snake River Plain) that could be due to various natural or anthropogenic factors. Central to the goals of the sponsoring organization were detection and description of the effects of chronic exposure of plants to ionizing radiation from radionuclide deposited in the vicinity of test reactors and other facilities at the site. Virtually nothing was known at the time about the sensitivity of native species of plants to chronic radiation, nor of the response of communities to such plant sensitivity. Due to differences of grazing impact in various localities of the region, and to the fact that distinct vegetation types were evident, these factors were incorporated in the design of plot distribution. Little was known of the long-term vegetation changes resulting from normal climatic variability or successional dynamics in the sagebrush-grass region. There was much speculation but little evidence of the impact of grazing in the region. Large plots were established because of the desire to include numerous individual plants of each species in locations near radiation sources, and because some vegetation types are limited in extent.","French, Norman R.; Mitchell, John E.",,1983-11-01,plant damage; radiation injury;,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Bulletin Number 36,"Idaho SD12.I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/","College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences;",uifwre-b36,"some have it, some don't, all need to be: Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

The Vegetation Types of Craters of the Moon National Monument,"The maintenance and perpetuation of park ecosystems are becoming increasingly difficult. Knowledge and understanding of park resources provide keys to their protection. A first step in this process is the development of base-line measures of key resources. In most parks, data on vegetation resources are important base-line components.

Canyon Grasslands and Associated Shrublands of West-central Idaho and Adjacent Areas,"Grasslands dominated by perennial bunchgrasses occupy the canyon-like valleys of the Snake and Salmon Rivers and their tributaries in west-central Idaho. The grassland areas differ in elevation from 215 to 2400 m. (710-7800 feet) with slopes commonly of 45 to 70 percent and ranging to over 100 percent. Soils, mainly Xerolls, derived from volcanic materials are permeable and relatively stable. Vertical zonation of climate, vegetation and soils prevails, modified mainly by differences in aspect. Plant communities (series) characterized by Agropyron spicatum, Festuca idahoensis and Carex hoodii respectively, occupy most of the grassland area and form five habitat types. Minor types of less certain seral status occur at low elevations and are dominated by Sporobolus cryptandrus and Aristida longiseta. Small inclusions of shrub grass types are dominated by Artemisia rigida, Symphoricarpos albus, Rhus glabra, Cercocarpus ledifolius and Celtis reticulata. Vegetation altered by the effects of livestock grazing in the century of white settlement shows extensive loss of native species and replacement by aliens, mainly of Mediterranean origin. Principal invaders were Bromus tectorum and other annual bromes, but others, including several species of Centaurea, are increasing on depleted sites.","Tisdale, E.W.",,1986-04-01,xerolls;,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station","Bulletin - Number 40, April 1986","Idaho SD12.I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/","College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences;",uifwre-b40,"some have it, some don't, all need to be: Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Pathogenicity of Fusarium Isolates from Douglas-fir Seed and Container-Grown Seedlings,"Twenty Fusarium isolates from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Beissn.] Franco) seed and seedlings were evaluated for their effects on Douglas-fir seed germination, post-emergence damping-off, and seedling root disease. Inoculum consisting of perlite: cornmeal colonized with fungal isolates was mixed into peat: vermiculite growing medium then seed was sown or seedlings transplanted into the mixture. A wide range of virulence occurred in populations of Fusarium isolated from Douglas-fir. Several isolates were consistently the more virulent. As a group, F.oxysporum isolates were more virulent that F. ""roseum"" isolates, although some F. oxysporum isolates were quite virulent. Test isolates of F. sambucinum were not virulent. Both source of isolation (healthy versus diseased seed or seedlings) and species of Fusarium were unreliable predictors of potential virulence.","James, Robert L.; Dumroese, R.

Predicting Mortality and Scorch Height from Prescribed Burning for Ponderosa Pine in Northern Idaho,"Planning the use of prescribed fire in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities often requires an estimate of tree mortality. A logistic regression model was developed to estimate survival of fire-injured ponderosa pine from prescribed burning. Scorch height and diameter at breast height estimate the probability of survival. Once a ponderosa pine exceeds 45 cm in diameter, it has a high probability of survival for the range of intensities within this study. Since the model is based on scorch height, Van Wagner's (1973) scorch height predictive equations were tested using data collected from 21 experimental fall fires. The range of data includes fire line intensities from 16 to 860 Kcal/sec/m, ambient air temperatures from 13 to 29?C, and average scorch heights from 1 to 17 m. Van Wagner's second equation, where scorch height is a function of fire line intensity and ambient air temperature, should be used to predict scorch height. Regression coefficients should be developed for different tree species. The regression coefficient for ponderosa pine developed in this study is lower than the average value of other tree species. Fire line intensity and ambient air temperature account for only 68% of the variability in scorch height for ponderosa pine in this study. Large fuels or heavy duff loadings that provide ventilation and heat for extended periods of time may help further explain the variability.","Saveland, James M.; Bakken, Stephen R.; Neuenschwander, Leon F.",,1990-12-01,,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station","Bulletin - Number 53, December 1990","Idaho SD12.I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/","College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences;",uifwre-b53,"some have it, some don't, all need to be: Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

The Grazed-Class Method to Estimate Forage Utilization on Transitory Forest Rangelands,"This publication provides an explanation of the grazed class method of estimating forage utilization, including necessary data sheets. The grazed-class method of estimating forage utilization was developed for and tested on arid rangelands in the Southwest, but appears to have considerable potential in forested settings of the Pacific Northwest as well. It was designed to provide range resource managers with an accurate and easy-to-use tool to monitor livestock utilization of selected forage species. The procedure is based on the concept that when one or more key species of an area representative of a larger range type have been properly utilized, optimum use of that rangeland has been made. The method classifies grazed plants into utilization classes, based on the percent of total plant weight removed.","Kingery, James L.; Boyd, Carol; Kingery, Peggy E.",,1992-06-01,,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Bulletin Number 54,"Idaho SD12.I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/","College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences;",uifwre-b54,"some have it, some don't, all need to be: Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Habitat Suitability Index Procedure for Columbian Sharp-tailed Grouse,"Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus) occupy &lt;10 percent of their historic range. Because of recent increases in some sharp-tailed grouse populations, improved range condition, and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), interest in transplanting Columbian sharp-tailed grouse into historic range within the state of Idaho and surrounding Western States has increased. Unfortunately, a habitat suitability index (HSI) to systematically evaluate and rank potential release sites for the Columbian subspecies is not available. Therefore, after evaluating the HSI for the plans sharp-tailed grouse (T. p. jamesi), we developed an index more applicable to the Columbian subspecies. Four areas in southeastern Idaho, All known to support viable populations of sharp-tailed grouse, were chosen to develop the procedure. The HSI is divided into 2 components, each representing a seasonal habitat of Columbian sharp-tailed grouse. Both winter food/cover habitat and nest/brood cover habitat were evaluated using the concept of percent equivalent optimum area. The equivalent optimum area concept assumes that a large area of low quality can have a habitat value equivalent to a smaller area of higher quality. Our HSI provides a systematic method to evaluate habitat quality for Columbian sharp-tailed grouse. It can also provide values which are compatible with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services' Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP). The HSI can also be used to determine the amount of mitigation crediting a particular site may provide and be used by biologists without considerable experience in sharp-tailed grouse biology.","Meints, Daryl R.; Connelly, John W.; Reese, Kerry P.; Sands, Alan R.; Hemker, Thomas P.",,1992-11-01,,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Bulletin Number 55,"Idaho SD12.I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/","College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences;",uifwre-b55,"some have it, some don't, all need to be: Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

The Role of Recreation and Leisure Travel in Idaho's Economy,"Recreation and other leisure travel spending appear to be increasingly significant contributors to Idaho's economic health. This is especially true in particular communities and subregions in the state, such as Sandpoint, Coeur d'Alene, McCall, Sun Valley, and travel corridors such as those in southeastern Idaho that access the Yellowstone-Teton complex. This study considers spending by recreation and leisure travelers in Idaho and the contribution of this spending to the state through economic diversification and rural economic development. We first present the framework for our analysis, including Idaho's economic base, spatial features of the Idaho economy, and the economic role of recreation and leisure travel in Idaho. This discussion of that role requires an understanding of the importance of both basic and service industries in Idaho's amenity economy. That economy includes the spending by ""traditional tourists"" (out-of-region visitors traveling for recreation or pleasure), convention travelers, and residents from particular Idaho regions active in leisure and recreation pursuits within those regions, as well as retirees, the independently wealthy and residents who are ""footloose,"" or location-independent in their occupations. Finally, that economy also includes interstate trade generated by amenity resources in Idaho's economy. We then focus on our assessment of the extent to which expenditures by traditional tourists, in-region leisure travelers and convention travelers contribute to the Idaho economy, describing the results of a study conducted to collect these expenditure data and their use in three models of Idaho's regional economies. The report concludes with a discussion of the major conclusions that can be drawn from our research.","Harris, Charles C.; Robison, M.H.",,1992-12-01,,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Bulletin Number 56,"Idaho SD12.I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/","College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences;",uifwre-b56,"some have it, some don't, all need to be: Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.
